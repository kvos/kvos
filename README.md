I'm a Remote Sensing Scientist at the Water division of the [NSW Department of Planning and Environment](https://www.dpie.nsw.gov.au/water). I have a PhD from the [Water Research Laboratory](https://www.wrl.unsw.edu.au/), [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). My interest is in satellite remote sensing for Earth sciences, development of webGIS applications and machine learning classification/regression problems. I mainly code in Python and use big data cloud computing platforms (like Google Earth Engine) to extract useful data from publicly available satellite imagery. 

I enjoy developing open-source remote sensing tools and creating web applications to visualise geospatial data. I also have experience as a data scientist solving regression/classification machine learning problems and decision making problems with reinforcement learning (Pytorch/Tensorflow).

More info about my research and projects can be found on my [personal website](https://kvos.github.io/).
